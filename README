===========
Config file
===========

as3hx looks for, or creates, a config file in your home directory
called ".as3hx_config.xml". You can also create one in the directory
you are running as3hx from, which will override the home file.

indentChars: (String=\t)
	The characters used to indent each line
newlineChars: (String=\n)
	The characters used to terminate each line
bracesOnNewline: (Bool=true)
	If set, opening braces will be put on a new line
uintToInt: (Bool=false)
	If set, all uint in flash will be translated to Int
vectorToArray: (Bool=false)
	If set, all Vectors will be changed to Arrays
guessCasts: (Bool=true)
	Cast guessing should likely be on, as it will change
	any MyClass(obj) to a cast(obj, MyClass) call.
functionToDynamic: (Bool=false)
	If set, Function will be translated to Dynamic
getterMethods: (String=get%I)
	Can be set to change the names of getters.
	%I : field name with first letter capitalized
	%i : field name unchanged (ex. get_%i)
setterMethods: (String=set%I)
	Can be set to change the names of setters
getterSetterStyle: (String="haxe")
	"haxe": a field will be created with haxe style setters
	        and getters. (var m(getM,setM))
	"flash": only native getters and setters will be created
	        using @:getter and @:setter
	"combined": both will be generated

For the "combined" getterSetterStyle, code output will look
similar to:

#if flash
        @:getter(target) function get_target() : {} {
                return proxy;
        }
#else
        override function get_target() : Dynamic {
                return proxy;
        }
#end

E4X:

No E4X is done as of yet. This will fail.
Solution: Comment out the function in the source code, and re-run. 

for each ( var v:XML in classInfo..*.(
      name() == "variable"
      || ( 
            name() == "accessor"
            // Issue #116 - Make sure accessors are readable
            && attribute( "access" ).charAt( 0 ) == "r" )
         ) 
)

For Initializations:
================================
The output of 

if(true) {
	for(var i:uint = 0; i < 7; i++)
		val += "0";				
} else {
	for(i = 0; i < 8; i++)
		val += "0";
}

is 

if(true) {
	var i : UInt = 0;
	while(i < 7) {
			val += "0";
			i++;
	}
} else {
	i = 0;
	while(i < 8) {
			val += "0";
			i++;
	}
}

As you can see, the scope of "i" in flash is not the same as in haxe, 
so the "else" section will produce Unknown identifier : i. The solution
is to move the "var i : UInt = 0;" outside of the blocks in the generated
code.

This can not be avoided by always creating the i variable, as the code

for(var i:uint = 0; i < 7; i++)
	val += "0";				
for(i = 0; i < 8; i++)
	val += "0";

would then produce a double initialization of i, also causing a compiler error.
 
var i : UInt = 0;
while(i < 7) {
	val += "0";
	i++;
}
var i = 0;
while(i < 8)
{
	val += "0";
	i++;
}
